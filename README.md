# unity-fsharp-integration

- Requires [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Download the [Unity package here](https://github.com/sppt-2k19/unity-fsharp-integration/raw/master/unity-fsharp-integration.unitypackage)

Installing this Unity package adds an F# menu to the Unity editor
This menu allows you to create and compile F# projects located inside the Unity-project, but preferably not inside the Assets folder.
- Create an F# project with the required references for Unity development
- Compile F# projects and copy the .dll to the `Assets/`-folder, so Unity can load classes from it
